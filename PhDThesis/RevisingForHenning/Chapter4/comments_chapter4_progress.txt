Chapter 4

526, 524-532 What is special about the time-dependent analysis? It seems there is no
  dedicated section to discuss this? My understanding was that the time-dependent
  flux should be a highlight of this thesis, so emphasis should be put on any issues
  in the analysis that needs extra care when deriving the time-dependent
  results/uncertainties.


568/571 be much more specific, list the version numbers of all MC simulations used,
  give details about the data/MC ratio, including a plot as a function of p
1055:  
The systematic uncertainty on acceptance should also depend on how well the material budget of the detector is
described in the MC. Did you produce these MCs yourself? (Discuss in the general data
overview section.)


569 constant in log p means that the spectrum is proportional to -1. So which version
  was used, -2.7 or -1 or both? Why the difference? Why is it important for your analysis?

584 you could show a plot of event counts before and after rewighting and compared to ISS
  data, which should then match.
  Be more specific about the reweighting. Which formula did you use? Your thesis should
  contain every piece of information that is needed to reproduce your results.

Table 4.1: The "Description" column is not very illuminating. See Niko's thesis or
  Matthew Behlmann's thesis from MIT for examples on how to explain each quality cut
  with 2-3 sentences.

629: it would be good to see distributions of the quantities that you cut on, e.g. the
  reconstructed charges, from MC signal and/or tagged ISS signal events.

636 etc: Try to use mathematical notation to make your statements more concise,
  e.g., "$0.7<Q_\mathrm{TRK}<1.3$ is better than a long sentence. (But you have
  to define your quantities/notation, of course.)

1024 / Fig. 4.27: If the unfolding is important, you should do a toy MC study to show
that it works as expected on known input data.

Chapter 4.5 Effective Acceptance:
Fig. 4.17:
 - Why are the error bars vastly different? It seems that some of the ups and downs are much larger than the error bars. What is the physics behind this?
 - There should also be a plot of the p and pbar absolute acceptances for the three selections before showing this plot.

4.4 Template Fit里：
In general, a plot like Fig. 1 in the pbar/p paper (PRL 117, 091103
(2016)) would be good to explain the general analysis strategy.

4.10 Systematic Uncertainty:
You assume that the template shapes are known perfectly, but in
reality, they also come with some uncertainty / wiggle room, which
should lead to a systematic uncertainty. E.g., what happens when you
vary the cuts defining your templates? Or when you vary the templates
within their statistical uncertainty?


Fig. 4.28:
  - It is strange to show the value of an uncertainty when the value of the quantity itself has not been
  shown yet.
Fig. 4.30 / 1075: But before you show the value of the pbar/p ratio, an absolute
uncertainty is meaningless.


%%%% Intermediate Range:
Fig. 4.8.: Use consistent style (marker size?!) compared to Fig. 4.5.
   The range for the x-axis is very strange. Show the electron component in its entirety.
   Why not simply plot Lambda_TRD? No need to include the sign here?

Fig. 4.9: zoom into y-axis???

Fig. 4.13: 
    The chi2 at lower values of R is not really what would be expected for good fits?


---- 已经弄完,但需要最后检查一遍：
  - define $\Lambda_\mathrm{CC}$ for Charge Confusion Estimator and used it everywhere

727: define $\Lambda_\mathrm{TRD}$ for TRD likelihood estimator and used it everywhere,
  instead of terms like "TRDLikelihood".

%%%% Low Range:

Fig. 4.4 should display continuous lines, not data points. How are the lines chosen?
  You need to show distributions of the relevant variables to motivate your cuts.

Figs 4.5, 4.7: The chi2/ndf that you quote here is probably misleading. You have to quote
  both the chi2 and the ndf. Since this is a 2D template fit, ndf is probably large. But
  then a chi2/ndf indicates a very poor fit. 
Remove all chi2 plots?

Fig. 4.7: Use "$\chi^2/ndf$" consistently, not "Chi2/dof".



%%%% Intermediate Range:

%%%% High Range:

%%%% Time dependent analysis

Section 4.4.2: Are the templates derived individually for each time bin, or globally once
  and for all? Are the distribtutions stable in time?

Fig. 4.14: Again, the plot range is very strange路

Fig. 4.15, 4.16:
  - Plot dN/dt, where dt is livetime, to avoid the enormous jumps.
  - Keep the fonts / plot style consistent across your thesis.
