526, 524-532 What is special about the time-dependent analysis? It seems there is no
  dedicated section to discuss this? My understanding was that the time-dependent
  flux should be a highlight of this thesis, so emphasis should be put on any issues
  in the analysis that need extra care when deriving the time-dependent
  results/uncertainties.

## 4.1 Data Selection

565 interaction of what? discuss also digitization of the simulated signals, trigger
  simulation, etc.

568/571 be much more specfic, list the version numbers of all MC simulations used,
  give details about the data/MC ratio, including a plot as a function of p

584 you could show a plot of event counts before and after rewighting and compared to ISS
  data, which should then match.
  Be more specific about the reweighting. Which formula did you use? Your thesis should
  contain every piece of information that is needed to reproduce your results.

Table 4.1: The "Description" column is not very illuminating. See Niko's thesis or
  Matthew Behlmann's thesis from MIT for examples on how to explain each quality cut
  with 2-3 sentences.

619: The cut on single tracker track is very problematic as a preselection cut.
  Is the tracking efficiency well reproduced by the MC? Do you show fluxes in the
  end where this could matter?
add: focus on ratio.

629: it would be good to see distributions of the quanties that you cut on, e.g. the
  reconstructed charges, from MC signal and/or tagged ISS signal events.

## 4.2 Charge Confusion Estimator
## 11 Comments
##########################

668: it's not so simple. What if the rigidity in an event is wrongly reconstructed,
  but still positive? Then this event shows the same behavior as charge confusion
  and should not be used in the signal sample for training. You could define the
  signal sample to be within a few sigma_R around R_true. There should be a "gap"
  between the signal and background samples.
add£ºignore

Fig. 4.1:
  - the plot ranges for a,b,d are not chosen well: the distributions extend beyond
    the axis ranges

692: Can't you simply use the rigidity values from the inner vs all fits directly, instead
  of the chi2 values?

## 4.4 Template Fit

Table 4.4: 
  Why not use ECAL to get a clean e- template? add: description.
  Why can you use the number of TRD hits? They may be completely unrelated to the tracks in
  the TRD.
  Are the same TOF beta and TRD likelihood cuts used for all templates and data? Why? Why
  list them in the table in the first place? add: description.
(similar comments hold for Table 4.5)

Fig. 4.4 should display continuous lines, not data points. How are the lines chosen?
  You need to show distributions of the relevant variables to motivate your cuts.

Fig. 4.5:
  - Before Fig. 4.5, you should show the full 2D plot and then explain the projections.
  - Why does the pbar template not peak at zero?
  - The maximum in b) is too low, the result histogram is cut off at the top.
  - It seems that the range of the Lambda_TRD axis in b) is not chosen well. What
    about the left part of the distribution? Also, the choice for the axis range in a0
    is strange: The right part is almost empty, but the tail on the left side is cut off.
  - The fit results for the counts and their uncertainties should also be given in the legend.

Figs 4.5, 4.7: The chi2/ndf that you quote here is probably misleading. You have to quote
  both the chi2 and the ndf. Since this is a 2D template fit, ndf is probably large. But
  then a chi2/ndf indicates a very poor fit. 

Fig. 4.8.: 
   The range for the x-axis is very strange. Show the electron component in its entirety.

Fig. 4.11:
  - The number of events given in the legend (3817) does obviously not match the counts
    in the histograms. Likewise, where are the electrons seen in b) in the upper plot?
    Are there additional cuts on Lambda_TRD when drawing the Lambda_CC projection and v.v.?
    This has to be discussed in the text.

Fig. 4.12:  You did not discuss using different sets of tracker patterns before, did you? Instead of plotting the raw numbers, it would be better to draw, e.g, dN/dR, which should be a smooth curve independent of the binning. 
add: pattern->description.

Section 4.4.2: Are the templates derived individually for each time bin, or globally once
  and for all? Are the distribtutions stable in time?

Fig. 4.14: Again, the plot range is very strangeÂ·

Fig. 4.15, 4.16:
  - Plot dN/dt, where dt is livetime, to avoid the enormous jumps.

## 4.5 Effective Acceptance

Fig. 4.17:

 - Why are the error bars vastly different? It seems that some of the ups and downs are much larger than the error bars. What is the physics behind this?£¨11.10.2021 Group meeting£©

 - There should also be a plot of the p and pbar absolute acceptances
   for the three selections before showing this plot.

 - Lastly: This correction is HUGE. How do you know it is correct? Are
   there any crosschecks for this in AMS? According to the pbar/p
   paper (PRL 117, 091103 (2016)), the ratio is 1.15 at 1 GV, in your
   plot it's closer to 1.30.
add: cite PPT, due to cuts and selections, this value changes.

## 4.7 Trigger Efficiency

##########################

Fig. 4.25:
  - Why is this a continuous curve? It's probably extracted from
    binned data?
  - You can also get the trigger efficiency from MC and compare.
  - The trigger efficiency seems to be rather low. Do you have a
    crosscheck for the values?

## 4.8 Unfolding
## 3 Comments
##########################

1024 / Fig. 4.27: Does the figure show the effect of the unfolding on
the antiproton (or proton) counts? Or on the pbar/p ratio? In line
1023, you say "counts", in line 1024, you say "ratio". If it's the
counts, the effect of the unfolding should cancel in the final ratio?

If the unfolding is important, you should do a toy MC study to show
that it works as expected on known input data.
(raw number, acceptance)

1038: But in your discussion of the unfolding, neither measuring time
nor trigger efficiency are used or needed?

## 4.10 Systematic Uncertainty
## 14 Comments
##########################

1055: Why 10%? Why not 15%? 5%? This should be related to the
uncertainties on the cross section data. What does "the cross sections
are varied" mean? Randomly? Set to nominal +- 10%? I would assume that
they were varied individually for p and pbar and the two contributions
are added in quadrature? How does the ratio of acceptances (Fig. 4.17)
change in these cases? The systematic uncertainty on acceptance should
also depend on how well the material budget of the detector is
described in the MC.


Fig. 4.28:
  - It is strange to show the value of an uncertainty when the value of the quantity itself has not been shown yet.
add: 4.10:ratio with statistic error.

You assume that the template shapes are known perfectly, but in
reality, they also come with some uncertainty / wiggle room, which
should lead to a systematic uncertainty. E.g., what happens when you
vary the cuts defining your templates? Or when you vary the templates
within their statistical uncertainty?

Fig. 4.30 / 1075: But before you show the value of the pbar/p ratio, an absolute
uncertainty is meaningless.

Fig. 4.34: What about the statistical error? Adjust the plotting
style. I think that the systematic error should not fluctuate from
time bin to bin, but a constant value (average) should be used
instead.
add: add statis error in 4.37, remove total sys.
