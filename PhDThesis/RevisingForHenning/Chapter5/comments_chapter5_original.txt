General comments
================

- After reading the entire thesis, I feel that more emphasis should be
  put on the time-dependent results because they are really new, while
  the ratio has been published in PRL and Phys.Rep. before. But for
  this, you need more plots specific for the time-dependent analysis:
  how do the relevant distributions (CC estimator, charges, etc.;
  template shapes) evolve over time? Are they stable?

- It strikes me as a strange omission that all ingredients needed to
  calculate the p and pbar fluxes are given in the thesis, but the
  fluxes are never shown. The pbar/p ratio matches the published one
  very well. What about the fluxes? If they do not match, this should
  at least be mentioned in the thesis. A lot of emphasis is put on the
  measuring time and trigger efficiency, for example, even though they
  cancel in the ratio. It might be that the delta_p in Eqs. 4.6 and
  4.12 is different from one, and determining it would mean a
  substantial amount of work, but this should be discussed in the
  thesis.

- There are other sources of systematic error discussed in the PRL
  pbar paper. Even if the effects are not studies in this thesis, they
  should be mentioned and briefly discussed and the magnitudes
  compared to the uncertainties studied here.
  

Fig. 4.28: systematic error from acceptance is 5e-7 at low R,
Fig. 5.2: pbar/p is 0.01e-3 at low R
=> relative syst. uncertainty due to acceptance is 5%, yet the
correction from A_p/A_pbar is 30%. This appears to be a rather
aggressive error estimation.



Chapter 5
=========

1071: cite references

1086: quote period explicitly

I would label the y-axes of the relevant figures in this chapter as
$\bar{p}/p$, not "Antiproton to Proton ratio" or "Antiproton to Proton
flux ratio", both to avoid the inconsistency and to keep the labels
more concise.

Show the pbar/p ratio on a logarithmic scale, too.

Fig. 5.1:

 - remove the lines from the points in the legend
 - contrary to what you write in the text, there is a difference
   between the results from the low and intermediate range in the
   overlap region

Fig. 5.3:
  - remove the lines from the points in the legend
  - use the full textwidth for the figure
  - at low energies, there is a clear systematic deviation. I wonder
  if the problem might be related to the acceptance correction, which
  is largest at the lowest energies and whose magnitude is larger in
  your case than for the AMS analysis.

Fig. 5.4: Also compare to the total stat. and syst. errors from the
AMS publication.



Section 5.2: Use the same style (fonts!) for the figures as for section 5.1.

1106: Re-write: "Above 15 GV, no significant modulation effect is
observed." But you should show some data for >15 GV in Fig. 5.5!

1007-1110: I don't recognize the trends and effect that you describe
in your plots. Maybe you have to show more energy bins. Or rebin a few
low-energy bins.

1111: How would you go about that? It seems that your time binning is
already pushing the limit.

Figs. 5.6, 5.7: These plots make no sense to me: The systematic
uncertainty should be a constant in time (or a slowly changing curves,
possibly with jumps due to changes in the detector configuration), but
they should not fluctuate randomly. Likewise, the statistical error
may seem to flucutate because it depends on fluctuating event counts,
but more meaningful is the average level of the (relative!)
stat. error. So instead of the two figures, you could plot the level
of the (relatvive!) stat. and syst. errors for the time-dependent
ratio as a function of rigidity.

Fig. 5.8: This plot serves no purpose, Fig. 5.9. is much more
relevant. But this is a cross-check of the analysis that belongs to
Chapter 4. Instead of "merged" you mean "averaged".

1128: Please use a residual plot to show the deviation more
clearly. Probably a logarithmic y scale for Fig. 5.9 would be
better. It is strange that the two results do not match exactly.

1146: I don't recognize that the e-/e+ below 3 GV goes up with time,
only the pbar/p ratio shows this trend.

Fig. 5.10: Keep the style consistent with the other Figures. Remove
the blue circle around the e-/e+ data points.

It might be worthwhile to discuss these results with an expert on
solar modulation (Prof. Heber?), to add more weight to the physics
discussion.

I think you should tabulate your results on pbar/p vs time and
rigidity in the appendix.


Chapter 6
=========

1160 what is a "high" measurement?

1175: Yes, very good idea, and you found a very nice paper [108],
which even contains model predictions for the pbar/p ratio as a
function of time for one rigidity bin. So why don't you overlay data
from your analysis on their model curve (Figs. 19,20 from [108])? This
would be a huge benefit for your thesis because it would show that your
data can be used to test models on a level not possible before.

1185: This is not convincing because, according to Fig. 5.4, the systematic
uncertainty dominates the total uncertainty at the highest energies.


Appendix
========

This sections also needs careful notation, and do not use technical
slang like "Log10Chi2TrackerXInner" or "L24L58RigidityMatching".

It would be nice to have on section (variable) per page, with the
description and the corresponding plot on the same page.

1214: It seems that the chi2 from the inner tracker fit do not really
help.

1242: I don't think it's a good idea to include the TRD likelihood in
the charge confusion estimator because you also use it for the
template fit as an independent variable.


Remove list of tables and list of figures. This is a waste of paper.
