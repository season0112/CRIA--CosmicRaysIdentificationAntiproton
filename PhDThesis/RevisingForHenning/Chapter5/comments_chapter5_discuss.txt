General comments
================

- After reading the entire thesis, I feel that more emphasis should be
  put on the time-dependent results because they are really new, while
  the ratio has been published in PRL and Phys.Rep. before. But for
  this, you need more plots specific for the time-dependent analysis:
  how do the relevant distributions (CC estimator, charges, etc.;
  template shapes) evolve over time? Are they stable?

- It strikes me as a strange omission that all ingredients needed to
  calculate the p and pbar fluxes are given in the thesis, but the
  fluxes are never shown. The pbar/p ratio matches the published one
  very well. What about the fluxes? If they do not match, this should
  at least be mentioned in the thesis. A lot of emphasis is put on the
  measuring time and trigger efficiency, for example, even though they
  cancel in the ratio. It might be that the delta_p in Eqs. 4.6 and
  4.12 is different from one, and determining it would mean a
  substantial amount of work, but this should be discussed in the
  thesis.

- There are other sources of systematic error discussed in the PRL
  pbar paper. Even if the effects are not studies in this thesis, they
  should be mentioned and briefly discussed and the magnitudes
  compared to the uncertainties studied here.
  

Fig. 4.28: systematic error from acceptance is 5e-7 at low R,
Fig. 5.2: pbar/p is 0.01e-3 at low R
=> relative syst. uncertainty due to acceptance is 5%, yet the
correction from A_p/A_pbar is 30%. This appears to be a rather
aggressive error estimation.



Chapter 5
=========

Fig. 5.3:
  - at low energies, there is a clear systematic deviation. I wonder
  if the problem might be related to the acceptance correction, which
  is largest at the lowest energies and whose magnitude is larger in
  your case than for the AMS analysis.

1128: Please use a residual plot to show the deviation more
clearly. Probably a logarithmic y scale for Fig. 5.9 would be
better. It is strange that the two results do not match exactly.

It might be worthwhile to discuss these results with an expert on
solar modulation (Prof. Heber?), to add more weight to the physics
discussion.


Chapter 6
=========

1175: Yes, very good idea, and you found a very nice paper [108],
which even contains model predictions for the pbar/p ratio as a
function of time for one rigidity bin. So why don't you overlay data
from your analysis on their model curve (Figs. 19,20 from [108])? This
would be a huge benefit for your thesis because it would show that your
data can be used to test models on a level not possible before.




Appendix
========

1214: It seems that the chi2 from the inner tracker fit do not really
help.

1242: I don't think it's a good idea to include the TRD likelihood in
the charge confusion estimator because you also use it for the
template fit as an independent variable.
