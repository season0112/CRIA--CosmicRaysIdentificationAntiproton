source: Wiebusch p20?


p4:Does [10] contains references for all the data?
What about the inlet? It's not mentioned in the caption.
The word "different" is not very precise.
Compare: Fabian:p4. Bastian:p33, Niko:p16


p4:Strange Ref. Quote the original source.

p4:no, the figure illustrates the importance of secondary productio1n77 of CRs.
source: Wiebusch p62
solution: keep it, and add the comment.


p5: discuss the physics, energy output, rate of SNe, acceleration mechanism
solution: in detail later.

p7:  this can lead to adiabatic energy losses. but this term only describes the convection itself
Fabian: p6

p7:no, this is the work against the pressure of the interstellar gas
Fabian: p6




p19: this depends on Z
soution: for protons and electrons. 
based on: bastian p60.

未改的：
p4: C, Fe, ... Relation to stellar evolution...

p6:but 2nd order Fermi 198 acc. is not really 199 relevant for CRs?

p6:nobody really knows that... 
too detailed??
