39,41,353: "kind of" is a weak expression

47-50 do not really belong in a thesis abstract

52: what does the spectrum look like?

58: "Above 10 GV the time structure is mostly ignorable." is redundant
with "... the antiproton to proton flux ratio keeps stable in the high
rigidity range."

Fig. 2.1a, Fig. 2.2, Fig. 2.3b, Fig. 3.3, Fig. 3.5: quote original sources
instead of the references you use at the moment

103, and in general: no space between reference and '.'

122: Fig. 62c of the Phys. Rep. gives a different impression.

Eq. 2.1: remove parenthesis around "-gamma"

218: This sentence makes no sense to me.

Eq. 2.4: that's not really a "solution". What about the spatial
dependence?

284: but the diffusion coefficient is orders of magnitude smaller

472: $p$ etc.

Figs. 3.16, 3.17: put side by side at half size?

590: "should" implies that you did not actually do it, despite better
knowledge

611: But you just showed that the measuring time cancels from the
equations...?

657: discuss the jumps in the spectral shapes

668: a weight cannot be calculated as a ratio of event number over
flux, dimensions don't match

676: the "pass ratio" is not well defined. What exactly is the
denominator? Events before all cuts? After the previous cut? ...?

718, 722: show the charge distributions (after suitable cuts)

738: which cut value?

747: noise/spurious hits close to the particle track ...

778: but mathematically, this quantity should be between -1 and 1, in
contradiction with Fig. 4.2b.

793: is the training done separately in different rigidity bins? if
so, which binning?

Fig. 4.2: the range 330 to 525 GV refers to reconstructed rigidity?

822: the pdfs also depend on the layer number, Xe partial pressure and
pathlength inside the straw

Fig. 4.5: it seems that there is a contamination in the ISS electron
sample around Lambda_TRD=1, maybe from charge-confused protons? Do you
apply a cut on CC before filling these histograms?

831: what is a template fit?

850: the "secondaries" need more explanation/motivation. Also, they
appear to be awfully degenerate with electrons according to your
plots. How can the fit tell them apart from the electrons?

Table 4.4: I do not understand your choice of cuts here: How can you
compare beta_low to 1/beta_TOF? Why do you even allow negative beta?
The Lambda_TRD peaks at 0.4 for electrons, so you will cut almost all
of them away when constructing the electron template? What kind of
template is "negative rigidity data"?

Does table 4.4 only refer to the low rigidity range?

Motivate why you use 1/beta instead of beta.

869: You can simply define beta(R,m) once. Use $\pi$ for pion.

876, 1163: "official" is a bad word.

881: what is L? what is f? I don't think this notation makes sense.

883: the N_i are the free parameters in the fit

885: it makes no sense to cut Fig. 4.7 at x=0.7. Show the full plot,
and also for R>0, to illustrate where the contributions are found in
the 1/beta-Lambda plane. You need the protons to prove that the
antiprotons are not simply a tail of the electron distribution.

888: you should also show the full 2D plots (data and best-fit model)
first, for illustration. And what about R>0? You need the proton
counts, too.

Fig. 4.8: plot ranges are too narrow.

Fig. 4.9, 4.11: also plot the proton numbers

908: I do not understand this sentence.

Table 4.5: Also here, you cannot cut on the same quantity that you
want to extract a template for (Lambda_TRD).

Fig. 4.10: also show the R>0 side, or the sign(R) on the x-axis makes
no sense.

Figs. 4.9, 4.11, 4.14: use consistent notation (-> Eq. (4.7)), and avoid slang
("BinWidth").

911: you need a plot to illustrate this cut.

971: what about tau?

Figs. 4.15, 4.16, 4.19, 4.20, 4.29, and many others:
Keep the style of your figures consistent. Use boldface Arial fonts
like in Fig. 4.13.

Fig. 4.15: Lambda_TRD should not be negative. Use histograms instead
of points for electron, antiproton.

Fig. 4.16: these changes probably reflect the changing Xe partial pressure
in the TRD due to the way the TRD was operated.

Fig. 4.19: notation! Label x-axis ("date").

1004: not a complete sentence.

1019: which parameterizations? this was not mentioned before.

Fig. 4.21: Combine in a single plot, or at least use same y-range,
avoid yellow.

Fig. 4.22: never use yellow markers.

1021: I don't think that is true.

1026: time needed for readout

Figs. 4.23-4.26: do you really need these figures?

1080: but if IGRF is correct, your particles will be under-cutoff!?

Fig. 4.29: why does T drop in 2018?

1098: this is not really how unfolding works.

1110: No, you have to normalize every projection along y such that the
sum of probabilities is 1.

Fig. 4.31: The y-axis is poorly labelled. Avoid yellow and light cyan
markers. On this scale, and with so many different categories in the
plot, it's very hard to see anything.

I think to show that the results of the unfolding can be trusted, you
need at least a simple toy MC study. What happened to the ratio plot
of raw vs unfolded counts? How important is the unfolding?

1129: so how are the results calculated from the data in Fig. 4.32?

Fig. 4.35. Fig. 5.5: it's pbar/p / 10^-5, not pbar/p x 10^-5

1167: But in part, the spread seen here will be simply due to
statistical fluctuations.

Fig. 4.42: It's not really clear how you calculate the yellow
uncertainty band.

1212: you need a statement which syst. errors are correlated over
time.

Fig. 4.45: Plotting the relative uncertainties should simplify things,
e.g. the acceptance error should become constant?

Fig. 5.1: You should try to get some physics out of the data: Is there
a spectral break around 100 GeV? What is the significance? Are the
data consistent with a straight line in log R?

Fig. 5.2: "due to limited statistics": that is clearly not the
case. Could the deviation be related to different treatments of the
geomagnetic cutoff? Use the full text width for the figure. Legend:
quote time range (May 2011 - ...) instead.

1236: AMS-02~\cite{...ref2...}

1238-1239: remove line break

1251: Plus, you probably use stricter cuts.

Figs. 5.5, 5.9: Here, you may only use the statistical and time-dependent
systematic errors.

1270: I don't really see a rising trend.

1271: rephrase the (incomplete) sentence "At last, ..."

1271: there is no such thing as "the" solar modulation model

Fig. 5.6: you should be more precise on what "taken from [129]" means,
since the curve you display is not found in that paper.

Figs. 5.7, 5.8: separate syst. error into time-dependent and
time-independent errors. Syst. errors should be flat as a function of
time?

Fig. 5.9: It seems to me that you could match pbar/p and e-/e+ by
introducing a time-shift between the two, which decreases with
rigidity.

1343: This sentence doesn't really make sense.

1372, Fig. 2: you should see -1 < delta < 1

1382, Fig.3: wrong x-axis labels, "log" is missing

1398: you could show the plot for a different R range then.

Appendix: you quote uncertainties as 0.01 or 0.02, but in these cases,
an additional digit should be given.
